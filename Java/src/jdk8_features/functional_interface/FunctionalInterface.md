## Functional Interface

Functional Interface is an interface with **only one** abstract method. It can have any number 
of default or static methods. It can also declare methods of object class. But it can't have more than one abstract method.


Non-functional interface **can't** extend Functional Interface. And the Functional interface **can't** 
extend non-functional.

Functional interfaces **can** be extended by other functional interfaces if their abstract methods have the same signature.
